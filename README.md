Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (Multilinear Regression)
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features such as mileage, age, horsepower, and other relevant factors. The model is built using a machine learning technique called Multilinear Regression, which enables us to understand and predict car prices based on multiple input features.
